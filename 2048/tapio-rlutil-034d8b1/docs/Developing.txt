Title: Developing

This is a list of some development goals and guidelines used for developing this utility collection.

Goals:
 * Must be usable with both C and C++.
 * Must work on Windows and Linux.
 * Should work on Mac OSX.
 * As identical behaviour across platforms as possible.

Guidelines:
 * Comment using Natural Docs format http://www.naturaldocs.org
 * When creating global, overridable #defines or typedefs, prefix them with RLUTIL_ and use CAPS in the name.
 * Use tabs instead of spaces for intendation.
 * Prefer compact code (though not unclear).
 * C++ stuff inside rlutil namespace.
 * Use RLUTIL_STRING_T for string type and RLUTIL_PRINT for outputting.
 * If something cannot be implemented in both C and C++, it must be #ifdef'ed out so that the code still compiles even though the function is not present. These kind of functions must be documented.
